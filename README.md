AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath

Submitted by: Tony Logan

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

Summary

CodeMath is an Android calculator-style app that takes a number as input, performs a calculation, and instantly returns the result. The app demonstrates user interaction, input processing, and clean UI updates using Kotlin and modern Android practices. It was built to show how simple utility apps can perform real-time calculations with minimal code.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 🧮⚡📱

Notes

I learned how to build a simple but complete utility app using Kotlin, ViewBinding, and Android Studio. This project helped reinforce how user input flows into the UI and how calculations can be performed safely using Kotlin. I also practiced organizing layouts and making sure the UI updates only when valid input is entered.
